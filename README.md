This project simulates and analyzes the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It focuses on key stages like the launch, reentry, and recovery of the rocket. The goal is to understand how Falcon 9 works, especially its reusable design, which helps make space travel cheaper and more efficient.

🧑‍🚀 Features
Launch Simulation: Simulate the rocket's launch into space.

Reentry & Landing: Simulate the rocket's reentry and landing back on Earth.

Trajectory Tracking: Track the rocket's path in space.

Rocket Stages: Analyze different stages of the rocket’s flight.

Flight Data: Collect and show data like altitude and speed.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Used for running simulations and data analysis.

Matplotlib/Plotly: Used for plotting flight paths and other data.

NumPy/Pandas: For handling data.

SciPy: For advanced scientific calculations.

🌟 Goals
Build a simulation of Falcon 9’s flight from launch to landing.

Study how the rocket returns to Earth and lands safely.

Visualize the rocket’s speed, altitude, and fuel use.

Understand how Falcon 9’s reuse process works.
